            The PlayStation One was the very first PlayStation console ever to be released!
           It was released on September 9, 1995. It is also the only PlayStation not originally released in the 2000s.
           The PlayStation is a horizontal-lying console that came in two different case coverings, one being light grey.
           The differentiating factor between the two models of this console was the internal hardware improvements and additional ports in the back to make device connection
           easier.The top or face of the console consisted of a large circular placement where the gamer could insert the disk. To the left of this was a smaller circular button for
           the power and to the right of the cd part was the button to open the cd inserter. The back of the console has four ports:
           two for controllers and two for memory ports. The memory ports are interchangeable and capable of recognizing which controller is connected.
            Although the PS1 was not originally released in the 2000's, it was released in May 2000 and outsold the PlayStation Two which was also released that year.
           With the new and improved released PS1 came a faster console that was half the size of the original. It also combined the reset
           and power button, as well as consolidated the four ports on the back down to just 2. Finally, the dimensions of the PS1 include a height of 1.5”, a width of 7.6”, a depth of 5.67”, and a weight of 1.21 lb. Ultimately the PS1 is 640 x 480 px.
