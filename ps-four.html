            The PlayStation Four is somewhat modern, but it is not the newest. This PlayStation was 
           released on November 15, 2013. Similar to former PlayStations two and three, the PlayStation Four
           has two models: the original PlayStation Four and the PlayStation Four Pro. When they were released,
           the DualShock 4, which is a controller, was released as well. Starting with the regular PlayStation, it has
           500GB, or 1TB, of storage, a BD/ DVD drive, an Ethernet, and Bluetooth. Its external dimensions include a 
           mass of 2.1 kg, and approximately 265×39×288 mm (width × height × length). As for the PlayStation Four Pro, 
           it has 1TB of storage, a BD/ DVD drive, an Ethernet, and Bluetooth. Its external dimensions include a 
           mass of  3.3 kg, and approximately 295×55×327 mm (width × height × length). Both versions share many similarities,
           but what sets them apart is their size and their price. The PlayStation Four is smaller than the PlayStation Four Pro
           and has fewer technological advancements. The PlayStation Four Pro has 4K quality for better gaming graphics, unlike 
           the PS4 which can only go up to 1080. It also has three levels as opposed to only two, which the PS4 has. Despite the 
           advances in the PS4 Pro, it did not have an upgraded Blu-ray drive, however, and it is not able to play 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. 
           The last major difference is the price. The PlayStation Four costs 300 dollars, whereas the PlayStation Four pro costs closer 
           to 400 dollars. For the small price difference, and the balance of technological advancements, the choice of purchase may 
           be difficult, but both versions can accommodate many.
