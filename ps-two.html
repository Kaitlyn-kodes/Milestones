            The playstation two was the second playstation to come out. It was released October 26, 2000. The PlayStation Two is the first PS console 
          to stand vertically. It has two different versions: fat and slim. The "fat" version is obviously wider, but still verticle.
          It is also heavier and box-shaped. The slim, verticle standing as well, is sleek and has a flat design. Another differntiating point
          is that the fat version has more ports as opposed to is more succesful version, the PS2 slim. More ports allows for more compatibilty with different TVs.
          However, despite lacking the additional ports, the Slim version has more motherboard upgrades and a better appeal. The final comparison is there 
          dimensions. The Fat PS2 has a dimension of 301 x 178 x 78 mm, a weight of 2.1 kg and is large and bulky. The Slim 
          PS2 has a dimension of 230 x 28 x 152 mm  a weight of 0.9 kg and is compactSleek . When deciding which one to purchase, the slim PlayStation is a more 
          successful model, but some other factors may sway your purchase decison. The Fat PS2 has a higher power consumption as opposed to
           the slim PS2. The network adaptor on the Fat PS2 is a seperate purchase, whereas the slim PS2 has a built-in network adaptor.
          A major difference is the internal storage. The Fat PS2 has 40 GB, 80 GB, or 160 GB of internal storage, whereas the  slim PS2
          has no internal storage. Finally the Fat PS2 is cheaper, pricing anywhere from 50-80 dollars in current day, whereas the slim PS2 can range from 90-200 dollars in current day.
