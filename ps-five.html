            The PlayStation Five is the most recent PlayStation to be released from Sony, aside from the PSVR. It was released in April 2017.
           Much like every other PlayStation, Sony released two different versions of the PlayStation Five, however they are vastly
           similar, and only a hundred dollars apart. Ringing in at 499 is the PS5 with a 4K Blu-ray drive. The second, cheaper version is
           the PS5 Digital Edition. One of the best traits of the PS5 is its ability to refresh and run quickly. It can do this 
           due to it being powered by a custom eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and a custom AMD Radeon RDNA 2-based GPU. These allow for
           better graphics and faster clear clear-running graphics. Also, the PS5 has an SSD, which has 825GB of storage, much better than previous
           PlayStations. However, some of this storage is consumed by system processes and can be consumed quickly by different
           games, such as the newest Call Of Duty. In addition to the faster system and higher storage, the PS5 also has 3D audio,
           which has been said to be able to make you "see with sound". Soon Sony will release 3D headphones to accompany this. Like 
           the other PlayStations, the PS5 has an ethernet port, but unlike the PS2 it has 3 USB ports, two of which are in the back, while
           the other one is on the front. Along with the PS5 came the DualSense Controller. Significantly, it is the first PS controller to not 
           resemble the original PS controller.
